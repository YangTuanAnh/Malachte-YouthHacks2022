## Inspiration
One of the lessons we learnt in quarantine is that technology is a double-edged sword: It can be either very good for you or… maybe not so much.
While electronic devices are our main tool to dig in online learning, they easily steal our attention with platforms such as Instagram or TikTok with their promise to make us evacuate reality… but this can trap us and we may catch ourselves lacking in all of our other activities we must do in a day to keep us productive, we catch ourselves in the technology prison.
We have discovered the worst enemy a student in the never-ending pandemic has; procrastination. Procrastinating makes us lose our skill of recalling information and staying motivated during online learning.

## What it does
To end this unhealthy cycle our only solution is gamification and digital planning with the purpose to re-engage students to an efficient and high-yielding lifestyle. Team Malachite presents Malachte, your productivity tool, gamified.
The web app consists of 4 main features - a Pomodoro timer, a to-do list, a curated music playlist, and an account bar. For every task you finish, you gain 10 XP. For every 25 minutes finished with the Pomodoro Timer, you gain 25 XP. After a certain amount of XP, you gain levels to unlock new avatars by pressing the image.
User data is locally stored so you can return it whenever. This incentivizes the user to come back and use the web app in the long term! We are creating healthy habits while adding fulfilment to the students' lives.

## What's next for Malachte
We are sure that this solution will bring a better day to day life to all students because after all, they are our future and our present. So welcome to Malachte! We hope you enjoy your stay and continue to be motivated!
